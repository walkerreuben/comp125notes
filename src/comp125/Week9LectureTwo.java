	 * Javadoc
	 * 
	 * Javadoc is a style of writing comments for your code that is a particular
	 * way of writing comments to include the documentation for the code inside
	 * the code.
	 * 
	 * Instead of having a separate file for your documentation, you can have
	 * everything in the one file, which makes it easier to ensure you update
	 * the doc whenever you change the code.
	 * 
	 * I should write my own CSS file for javadoc, or find a nicer looking one
	 * than the default.
	 * 
	 * Can Javadoc give the index.html file a different icon to make it stick out more?
	 * 
	 * Don't use javadoc comments on private variables.
	 * 
	 * You wouldn't do javadoc comments on tests. Normal comments for these and the private variables.
