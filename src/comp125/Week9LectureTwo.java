	 * Javadoc
	 * 
	 * Javadoc is a style of writing comments for your code that is a particular way of writing comments to include the
	 * documentation for the code inside the code.
	 * 
	 * Instead of having a separate file for your documentation, you can have everything in the one file, which makes it
	 * easier to ensure you update the doc whenever you change the code.
	 * 
	 * I should write my own CSS file for javadoc, or find a nicer looking one than the default.
	 * 
	 * Can Javadoc give the index.html file a different icon to make it stick out more?
	 * 
	 * Don't use javadoc comments on private variables.
	 * 
	 * You wouldn't do javadoc comments on tests. Normal comments for these and the private variables.
	 * 
	 * You can put html code into javadoc comments.
	 * 
	 * Tests
	 * 
	 * Test driven development says that you start by writing the tests, then develop the code to fit the tests. Before
	 * we start solving the problem, we know what the answer should look like. So we can write the tests without the
	 * code.
	 * 
	 * This forces you to think about what the program is going to do.
