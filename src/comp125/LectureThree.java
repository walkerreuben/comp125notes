		 * More about classes and objects and a brief introduction to unit testing.
		 * 
		 * On Wednesday we designed a very simple class capable of storing a simple date in this year.
		 * We called it Date2014V2 by the time we finished it.
		 * 
		 * Each method should be tested in a program in which it is the only untested program.
		 * 
		 * Bottom up testing: First test all the methods invoked by a method before testing the method itself.
		 * 
		 * Sometimes we need to test a method that relies on other methods having been run already. This is called a stub.
		 * 
		 * Style of development that emphasises testing
		 * Write test cases first, based on stated requirements.
		 * For each test case note down the desired result.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * JUnit provides a testing framework for Java
		 * You can write code to call the code under test.
		 * You can make assertions about what should happen (that is, desired result).
		 * JUnit supports Test driven development
		 * Eclipse integrates JUnit
		 * This will come up in workshop classes next week.
