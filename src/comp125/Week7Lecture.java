		 * Post test and assignment 2 lecture. First lecture by Doctor Steve Cassidy.
		 * Only lecture this week due to Conception Day and the mid semester test.
		 * 
		 * Assignment 2 will be about GPS data.
		 * 
		 * We'll be working with CSV data. Basic data input, but would use a comma method.
		 * 
		 * The problem:
		 * Handle GPS track data
		 * Provide sumary statistics about tracks
		 * Sort lists of tracks for a user in different ways
		 * Find out if a track goes close to a landmark
		 * 
		 * Assignment 3
		 * Find the climbs on a track
		 * Find whether a track follows a certain segment
		 * Simplify a track - find the important points
		 * Draw a track and its elevation profile.
		 * 
		 * A waypoint is a single GPS measurement.
		 * A track is a collection of waypoints.
		 * A tracklog is a collection of tracks.
		 * 
		 * We then define a number of methods for these classes to achieve our goals.
		 * 
		 * The constructor for Waypoint introduces some new ideas.
		 * It takes a string that is a CSV representation of the waypoint, and it throws an exception if something goes wrong.
		 * 
		 * And exception is a way to signal an error condition from your code.
		 * Something goes wrong so you can't do what you are supposed to do
		 * One option would be to carry on and do the best you can
		 * Exceptions allow you to tell your caller that you failed.
		 * 
		 * Check the slides for the github link.
